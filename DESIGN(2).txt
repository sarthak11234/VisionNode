**1. Visual Identity & Palette**

* **Theme:** Deep Dark Mode (High contrast, professional).
* **Primary Background:** `#0F0F12` (Matte Black).
* **Secondary Surface:** `#1A1A1E` (Raised cards/containers).
* **Accent Color:** `#00D1FF` (Electric Cyan – used for active states and the "Agent Scanning" effect).
* **Success State:** `#00FF94` (Spring Green – for successful message dispatch).
* **Warning State:** `#FFB800` (Amber – for low-confidence OCR results).

**2. Typography**

* **Headings:** *Geist Sans* or *Inter* (Semi-bold, letter spacing: -0.02em).
* **Body/Data:** *JetBrains Mono* (To maintain a technical/developer feel for the phone numbers and JSON previews).

**3. Layout Structure**

* **Header:** Minimalist top bar. Left side: "Audition Agent / LAA-v1". Right side: "Ollama Status: Connected" with a glowing green dot.
* **Main Container:** Max-width 1200px, centered.
* **Hero Section (The "Dropzone"):**
* A large, dashed-border area for image uploads.
* When an image is dragged over, the border glows in the accent color (`#00D1FF`).
* Animation: A horizontal "scanning beam" passes over the image preview while the Local Vision Model is processing.



**4. The "Agentic" Data Table (Interaction Design)**

* **States:**
* *Scanning:* Skeleton loaders reflecting the table structure.
* *Ready:* Clean rows showing `[Name]`, `[Phone]`, `[Act]`, and `[Status]`.


* **Inline Editing:** Clicking any cell turns it into an input field (mimicking the "Human-in-the-loop" requirement).
* **Confidence Indicators:** If the Agent is unsure of a digit, the number is underlined in Amber. Hovering shows the tooltip: "Manual Verification Required."

**5. Animation & Motion (Inspired by Reference)**

* **Entrance:** Cards should slide up with a slight bounce (0.4s ease-out).
* **The "Send" Interaction:** * When the "Fire Invites" button is clicked, it transforms into a progress ring.
* As each message is sent, the corresponding row in the table highlights in Green and then subtly fades its opacity to signify completion.
* Micro-interaction: A "Checkmark" animation (similar to the Cashbox final logo state) appears when the entire queue is processed.



**6. Components (React/Tailwind)**

* `GlassCard`: Background blur (12px) with a subtle 1px border (`rgba(255,255,255,0.05)`).
* `ActionButton`: Solid accent color background, white text, transforms on hover (scale 1.02).
* `StatusTag`: Small pill-shaped badges for "Pending", "Sent", or "Failed".

**7. Mobile Responsiveness**

* The table converts to a "Card List" view on mobile to ensure you can snap a photo of the audition sheet and review the numbers directly on your phone while at the gathering.
