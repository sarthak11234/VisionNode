PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT (PRD)

Project Name:  SheetAgent (Agentic Spreadsheet Platform)
Status:        Draft / Initial Concept
Target User:   College Fest Organizers, Club Leads, Recruitment Teams

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
A platform that combines the flexibility of Google Sheets with the power of 
autonomous AI agents. The system allows users to manage audition/registration 
data and triggers agents to handle communication (WhatsApp, Email, Group 
Creation) based on row-level status changes.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. USER PROBLEMS & GOALS
- Problem: Manual data cleaning and switching between Sheets and WhatsApp/Email.
- Problem: High latency in informing candidates of their status.
- Goal: Create a "State-Aware" spreadsheet where the data *is* the trigger.
- Goal: Centralize audition workflows into a single agent-controlled dashboard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS (FRs)

FR1: Dynamic Spreadsheet Engine
- Users can create "Workspaces" (e.g., "Dance Auditions 2026").
- Support for dynamic column addition (String, Number, Dropdown, Boolean).
- Real-time cell editing with auto-save to a FastAPI backend.

FR2: Agent Orchestration Layer
- An "Agent Sidebar" to configure automation rules.
- Rule Example: "If column 'Status' == 'Selected', send WhatsApp Template 'Welcome_Msg'".
- Ability for the Agent to read the entire sheet context to provide summaries.

FR3: Communication Integrations
- WhatsApp: Integration with Twilio/Meta API for 1-to-1 messaging.
- WhatsApp Groups: Agent generates and distributes group invite links.
- Email: Integration with Resend/Nodemailer for official PDF/Invite delivery.

FR4: Data Cleaning Tools
- One-click "De-duplicate" based on Roll No or Email.
- Format normalization (ensuring phone numbers have country codes).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE



A. Frontend: React.js + TanStack Table (for high-performance data grids).
B. Backend: FastAPI (Modular routers for Sheets, Agents, and Integrations).
C. Database: PostgreSQL with JSONB (to store the flexible column schemas).
D. Agent Framework: LangGraph (to manage the state-machine logic of "Check -> Trigger -> Confirm").

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. USER FLOW
1. Admin creates a sheet and imports CSV or adds columns manually.
2. Admin defines an "Agent Rule" (e.g., 'Notify' action on 'Status' change).
3. As judges enter scores/status in the sheet, the Agent queues messages.
4. Agent provides a "Log" of successful/failed communications.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. SUCCESS METRICS
- Reduce time-to-contact from hours to seconds.
- 0% manual errors in copying phone numbers to WhatsApp.
- Successful automated creation of participant groups.
