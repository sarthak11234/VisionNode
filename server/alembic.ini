# Alembic Configuration File
#
# HOW ALEMBIC WORKS:
#   Alembic tracks DB schema versions. Each "revision" is a Python file
#   with upgrade() and downgrade() functions containing SQL changes.
#
#   Key commands:
#     alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"  → Generate migration
#     alembic upgrade head                              → Apply all pending
#     alembic downgrade -1                              → Rollback one step
#
#   Autogenerate compares your SQLAlchemy models against the actual DB
#   schema and generates the diff automatically. Magic.
#
#   Alternative: Raw SQL migrations (like Flyway) — more control, but you
#   write every ALTER TABLE by hand. Alembic + autogenerate saves massive time.
