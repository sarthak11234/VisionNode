   88:9   error    Error: Cannot access refs during render

React refs are values that are not needed for rendering. Refs should only be accessed outside of render, such as in event handlers or effects. Accessing a ref value (the `current` property) during render can cause your component not to update as expected (https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef).

  219:19  warning  Compilation Skipped: Use of incompatible library

This API returns functions which cannot be memoized without leading to stale UI. To prevent this, by default React Compiler will skip memoizing this component/hook. However, you may see issues if values from this API are passed to other components/hooks that are memoized.
